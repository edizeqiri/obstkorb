# What I did

- Wrote the thesis.

# What I will do

- Hand in the thesis on friday.

# Questions

- In the overleaf template there is a Declaration of Scientific Integrity. Is this the same like in the seminar and do I have to add it at the end?

# Progress Report

- [x] Create Github repo, roadmap and plan the work
- [x] Read related work on the fuzzy hashers and write down the knowledge
- [x] Play around with Machoke and TLSH to see how they behave and work
- [x] Plan the Testing Framework including the database schema
- [x] Webscrape the biggest categorized malware samples publicly available
- [x] Normalize the data and run test the Testing Framework on them
- [x] Download all the Scicore apps in /scicore/soft/apps
- [x] Use the testing framework on the retrieved data (Only Malware for now / Next week Scicore binaries too)
- [x] Find the compare score sweet spots for the fuzzy hashers based on the false positive rate
- [x] Get to know statistical testing and learn their meaning to verify the results
- [x] Generate statistical tests for the results and compare them with a ROC curve
- [x] Add the Machoke results and compare them with the other fuzzy hashers
- [x] Add the String command results and compare them with the other fuzzy hashers
- [x] Use the miniHPC to run the ROC curve calculations and Machoke
