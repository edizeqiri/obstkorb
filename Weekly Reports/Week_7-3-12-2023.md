Bachelor Thesis (15 CP): A Study of Malware Detection Techniques for HPC Application Recognition

# What I did

- Created a script to get all the relevant Scicore binaries from /scicore/soft/apps by comparing the names of the folders and finding the longest matching substring of the folders and their respective binaries.
- Loaded the scicore binaries into the db with the testing framework.
- Made a jupyter notebook and ran some basic statistics on the scicore data.
  - Only looked at TLSH and ssdeep for this week.
  - Using ssdeep on the scicore binaries is bascially useless. True positive rate is lower than 10% for the scicore binaries.
  - Generated a ROC curve to showcase the effectiveness.

# What I will do

# Questions

# Progress Report

- [x] Create Github repo, roadmap and plan the work
- [x] Read related work on the fuzzy hashers and write down the knowledge
- [x] Play around with Machoke and TLSH to see how they behave and work
- [x] Plan the Testing Framework including the database schema
- [x] Webscrape the biggest categorized malware samples publicly available
- [x] Normalize the data and run test the Testing Framework on them
- [x] Download all the Scicore apps in /scicore/soft/apps
- [x] Use the testing framework on the retrieved data
- [ ] Find the compare score sweet spots for the fuzzy hashers based on the false positive rate
- [ ] Get to know statistical testing and learn their meaning to verify the results
- [ ] Generate statistical tests for the results and compare them with a ROC curve
- [ ] Build a heuristic for the "Obstkorb" framework based on the results before
- [ ] Nice to have: Use fuzzy hashers as features for machine learning and build a model
