# What I did

I analyzed the different fuzzy hashers and gathered their respective papers (saved in my local zotero). While reading the papers I got a more deeper understanding of how they function on a technical level.

Most of the fuzzy hashers are not maid specificly to recognize binaries but are made for arbitrary input (Besides Machoc and arbitrary meaning not to small and not to big).


My thoughts on the fuzzy hashers are in my git repo https://github.com/edizeqiri/obstkorb/blob/main/Docs/Fuzzy_Hashers.md

# What I will do

The main goal is still to strengthen my understanding of the different algorithms. I want to be able to fully go through 1 iteration of each algorithm by hand to know exactly how they work.

Next on the roadmap is to start creating the testing framework for the different fuzzy hashers, after I gathered enough knowledge to feel confident with the algorithms.

# What else

While reading the paper of Trend Micro, I got inspired in what way my thesis will be heading to. I will most likely compare the different fuzzy hashers based on our own dataset and compare the results based on the ROC-curve, their performance and the impact of change in a binary. The end goal will be a framework which can be used based on the results
