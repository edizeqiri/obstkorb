# What I did

- Created the database with the hashing information of all the fuzzy hashers.
- Created a share for my local network with all the malware families
- Noticed that my local Microsoft Defender was slowly deleting my samples without telling me.
  - Need therefore to unzip the data again, since the zips did not get deleted.
- Bug fixed the testing framework. Can now pump in arbitrary data and return a database with the right schema.
  - more than 120k samples were hashed and loaded in under 15 minutes
- Made a cool script to get the specific binary of each scicore application.
  - Example: when the folder is called "nodejs" and there are multiple binaries, then only the one which is called "node"
  - To do this I need to find
