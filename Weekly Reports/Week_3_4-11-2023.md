# What I did

- Raised Jira in Scicore to get all binaries. I asked for their permission as I did not want to do something against their policies (eg. mass exfiltration of data)
- While waiting for Scicore => Web scraped malware database to get 150GB of classified malware families (all compressed). Took way longer then expected to prepare the data for downloading every sample
- Mulithreaded the download script for efficiency (10% took 4h without it, with 20 threads took 8h)
- Build the testing framework and planned the schema of the database

# What I will do

- Get all fuzzy hashers and implement them into the framework. Planned are sdHash, ssDeep, TLSH and Machoc for now.
- Test the hashers and try to get a feel how how the fuzzy hashers repsond to the dataset.
- Found a lot of papers about fuzzy hashers and will read them further.

# What else

- Think about Machine learning and feature selection as a possibilty, depending on the results of the fuzzy hashers
- Plan how to dockerize the framework.
